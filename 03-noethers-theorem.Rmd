# Noether's theorem
Noether's theorem elucidates how continuous symmetries 
result in conserved quantities; the converse will be given 
by Hamiltonian mechanics. 
The key points in this section are: 

1. The definition of a continuous symmetry. 
2. Noether's theorem. 
3. The conserved-quantity when $\mca L$ is time-invariant: the Hamiltonian. 

It's convenient to now define a quantity we'll be using later very often: 

:::{.definition name="canonical momentum"}
Given the Lagrangian $\mca L(q, \dot q, t)$ of a system, 
its canonical momentum is 
\[ 
    p = \nabla_{\dot q} \mca L(q, \dot q, t)
\] 
In terms of the canonical momentum, the Euler-Lagrange 
equations read 
\[ 
    \mbb L_q = \dot p - \nabla_q \mca L = 0
\] 
:::

We will make extensive use of lemma \@ref(lem:calcVariation), which 
we state here again using the canonical momentum for convenience: 

:::{.lemma #calcVariation1 name="Îµ-derivative of the perturbed Lagrangian"}
Given a path $q:[a, b]\to \R$ and a perturbation path $\eta:[a, b]\to \R$, 
define the parameterized family of paths $q_\epsilon=q + \epsilon \eta$, then 
\[ 
    d_\epsilon \mca L(q_\epsilon, \dot q_\epsilon) 
    = -\eta \cdot \mbb L_q + d_t \left(\eta \cdot p\right)
\] 
:::

:::{.definition name="continuous symmetry"}
Consider a family of maps $q_\epsilon$ such that $q_0$ is the classical 
trajectory w.r.t. the Lagrangian $\mca L$. Define 
\[ 
    \mca L_\epsilon = \mca L(q_\epsilon, \dot q_\epsilon, t)
\] 
as well as the parameterized action function 
\[ 
    S_\epsilon = \int_a^b \mca L(q_\epsilon, \dot q_\epsilon, t)\, dt 
\] 
The physical system has continuous symmetry under the transformation 
parameterized by $q\mapsto q_\epsilon$ if 
\[ 
    d_\epsilon \big|_0 S_\epsilon = C
\] 
where $C$ is a constant independent of the dynamical variables $q, \dot q, t$. 
In other words, infinitesimal reparameterization by $\epsilon$ 
leaves the equations of motion unchanged. 
:::

:::{.proposition name="characterization of continuous symmetry via Lagrangian"}
$\epsilon \mapsto q_\epsilon$ is a continuous symmetry if 
\[ 
    d_\epsilon \big|_0 \mca L_\epsilon = d_t F(q, \dot q, t)
\] 
Note that the right-hand side must be a **total time derivative.**
:::
_Proof:_ Direct computation: 
\[ 
    d_\epsilon \big|_0 S_\epsilon = 
    \int_a^b d_\epsilon \big|_0 \mca L_\epsilon \, dt 
    = \int_a^b d_t(F) \, dt = F(b)-F(a)
\] 

:::{.theorem #noether name="Noether's theorem"}
Given a continuous symmetry $q_\epsilon$ such that 
\[ 
    d_\epsilon \big|_0 \mca L(q_\epsilon, \dot q_\epsilon, t) 
    = d_t F(q, \dot q, t)
\] 
THe following Noether change is conserved along a classical 
trajectory obeying the Euler-Lagrange equations 
\[
    Q = \left(d_\epsilon \big|_0 q_\epsilon \right) \cdot 
    \nabla_{\dot q}\mca L(q, \dot q, t) - F(q, \dot q, t)
\]
Let $q_\epsilon = q + \epsilon \eta$ for small $\epsilon$ 
(this is effectively adapting vector field perspective), 
the Noether charge is 
\[ 
    Q = \eta \cdot p - F(q, \dot q, t)
\] 
:::
_Proof:_ Direct computation invoking lemma \@ref(lem:calcVariation1): 
the $\mbb L_q$ term vanishes on the classical trajectory 
\begin{align}
    d_t F 
    &= d_\epsilon \big|_0 \mca L(q_\epsilon, \dot q_\epsilon) 
    = - \eta \cdot \mbb L_q + d_t(\eta \cdot p) 
    = d_t(\eta \cdot p) 
\end{align}
This implies that the time-derivative of the Noether charge is $0$. 


:::{.proposition name="conservation of energy"}
Let $\mca L$ be independent of time and denote the 
time-translation transform 
\[ 
    q_\epsilon(t) = q(t+\epsilon)
\] 
This is a continuous symmetry with $F(q, \dot q) = \mca L(q, \dot q)$ 
\[ 
    d_\epsilon \big|_0 \mca L(q_\epsilon, \dot q_\epsilon)
    = d_t \mca L
\] 
The associated $\eta = d_\epsilon \big|_0 q_\epsilon 
= d_\epsilon \big|_0 q(t+\epsilon) = \dot q$. Substituting 
into Noether's theorem yields the conserved quantity 
\[ 
    H = \dot q\cdot p - \mca L(q, \dot q)
\]
