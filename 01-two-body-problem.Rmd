# Two-body problem
We approach the two-body problem in the following steps: 

1. Reduce to one-body motion. 
2. Identify the conserved quantities: energy $E$, 
angular-momentum $\mbf L$, and Runge-Lenz vector $\mb \epsilon$.
    - $E$ is conserved when the potential $V$ is time-invariant. 
    - $\mbf L$ is conserved when $V$ is central. 
    - $\mb \epsilon$ is conserved when $V\propto r^{-2}$. 
    Orbits of such potentials have conserved eccentricity. 
3. Reduce to planar motion using conservation of $\mbf L$. 
4. Derive the orbit equations from conserved quantities. 
5. Analyze the different kinds of orbits by 
    looking at the one-dimensional effective potential $V_{\mrm{eff}}$. 
6. Analyze scattering. 


## Problem setup {-}
::: {.definition #twoBodyProblem name="two-body problem"}
Consider two particles with mass $m_1, m_2$ 
at locations $\mbf x_1, \mbf x_2 \in \R^3$. 
Their potential is 
\[ 
    V(\mbf x_1, \mbf x_2) = -\df{k}{|\mbf x_1-\mbf x_2|}
\] 
Here $k\in \R$ is a constant. The interaction is attractive 
when $k>0$ and repulsive when $k<0$. 
:::
Computing the force based on the potential: 
\[ 
    \mbf F_j 
    = -\nabla_{\mbf x_j}V(\mbf x_1, \mbf x_2)
    = \df{k}{|\mbf x_1 - \mbf x_2|^2} 
    \nabla_{\mbf x_j}|\mbf x_1 - \mbf x_2|
    = \df{k}{|\mbf x_1-\mbf x_2|^2} 
    \begin{cases}
        (\mbf x_1 - \mbf x_2) & j = 1 \\ 
        (\mbf x_2 - \mbf x_1) & j = 2 
    \end{cases}
    (\#eq:twoBodyForce)
\] 
Note that $\mbf F_1 + \mbf F_2 = 0$. 
Recalling Newton's second law, the equations of motion are 
\[ 
    \ddot {\mbf x}_j = \mbf F_j / m_j 
\] 

Instead of solving for $\mbf x_1, \mbf x_2$, one 
can solve instead for the motion of the center of mass 
$\mbf R$ and displacement $\mbf r$. The motion of $\mbf R$ 
will be trivial. 

::: {.proposition name="center of mass motion"}
Define the center of mass 
\[ 
    \mbf R = \df{m_1}{m_1+m_2} \mbf x_1 + \df{m_2}{m_1+m_2}\mbf x_2 
\] 
The equation for the center of mass is 
\[ 
    (m_1+m_2)\ddot {\mbf R} = m_1\ddot{\mbf r}_1 + m_2\ddot{\mbf r}_2 
    = \mbf F_1 + \mbf F_2 = 0 
\] 
The motion of the center of mass is thus completely determined by the 
initial conditions of the problem. 
:::

::: {.definition name="relative coordinates, displacement"}
Define the relative coordinates $\mbf r_j = \mbf x_j - \mbf R$ 
and displacement $\mbf r = \mbf x_2 - \mbf x_1$. 
Denote by $r=|\mbf r|, \mbf n = \mbf r / r$. 
Note that $\mbf n$ points in the direction $1\to 2$. 
:::

::: {.proposition name="one-body equation"}
The coordinates $\mbf r$ obeys 
\[ 
    \ddot {\mbf r} = \mbf F/\mu, 
    \quad \mbf F = -\nabla_{\mbf r} V(r) = -\df{k}{r^3} \mbf r
    \quad \mu = \df{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2}
\] 
Here $\mu$ is the reduced mass which satisfies $1/m_1 + 1/m_2 = 1/\mu$. 
It is the "effective" mass of the one-body "particle" 
corresponding to the two-body problem. 
Additionally define the one-body momentum 
\[ 
    \mbf p = \mu \dot {\mbf r}, \quad \dot {\mbf p} = \mbf F 
\] 

_Proof:_ Rewriting \@ref(eq:twoBodyForce) in terms of the 
newly defined quantities: 
\begin{align} 
    m_1 \ddot {\mbf x}_1 
    &= \df{k}{r^2}\mbf n 
    = -m_2 \ddot {\mbf x}_2 \\ 
    \ddot {\mbf r} 
    &= \ddot {\mbf x}_2 - \ddot {\mbf x}_1
    = -\left(\df 1 {m_2} + \df 1 {m_1}\right)\df{k}{r^2} \mbf n 
    = - \df{k}{\mu r^2}\mbf n 
\end{align}

## Three conserved quantities {-}
::: {.definition name="conserved quantity (non-relativistic)"}
In Newtonian mechanics, a quantity is ''conserved'' if 
it remains constant under time-evolution. 
:::

::: {.proposition name="conservation of energy"}
The energy scalar 
\[ 
    E = T + V = \df{\mbf p^2}{2\mu} + V 
\] 
is conserved by Newton's equation of motion 
$\mu \ddot {\mbf r} = \mbf F = -\nabla_{\mbf r} V(r)$ 

_Proof:_ Direct computation 
\[ 
    d_t E = d_t \left(
        \df{\mu^2 \dot {\mbf r} \cdot \dot {\mbf r}}{2\mu} + V
    \right) 
    = \mu \dot {\mbf r}\cdot \ddot {\mbf r} 
    - (\nabla_{\mbf r} V) \cdot \mbf r = 0 
\] 
Note that $d_tV$ is computed according to 
the dependence $V\leftarrow \mbf r\leftarrow t$. 
:::

::: {.proposition name="conservation of angular momentum"}
The angular momentum vector 
\[ 
    \mbf L = \mbf r\times \mbf p 
\] 
Is conserved for any _central force problem_: one in which 
$V(\mbf r)=V(r, \mbf n) = V(r)$ is only dependent on the 
magnitude, but not direction, of $r$. 

_Proof:_ Direct computation 
\[ 
    d_t \mbf L 
    = d_t(\mbf r\times \mbf p)
    = \dot {\mbf r}\times \mbf p + \mbf r \times \mbf F
    = 0 + 0 
\] 
The first term vanishes by 
$\mbf p \parallel \dot {\mbf r}$ and the second by 
the definition of central potential. 
:::

::: {.remark}
This is our first example of symmetry-conservation. 
A central force problem demonstrates **spherical symmetry**. 
A rigorous definition of "symmetry" will be given soon. 
:::

::: {.proposition name="planar reduction"}
The trajectory $\mbf r$ lie in the plane 
orthogonal to $\mbf L$. Given this, let $\mbf n =\mbf r/r$ 
be the first unit component of the plane and the second 
\[ 
    \mbf l = (\mbf L \times \mbf r) / |\mbf L\times \mbf r| 
\] 
In polar coordinates, 
\[ 
    \dot {\mbf r} = \dot r \mbf n + r\dot \theta \mbf l 
    \implies \mbf L = \mu r^2 \dot \theta (\mbf n\times \mbf l)
\] 

_Proof:_ $\mbf L = \mu \, \mbf r \times \dot {\mbf r}$ 
is orthogonal to both $\mbf r$ and $\dot {\mbf r}$, and 
$\mbf L$ is conserved. 
:::

::: {.proposition #rungeLenzDefinition name="conservation of the Runge-Lenz vector"}
The Runge-Lenz vector $\mb \epsilon$ is defined as 
\[ 
    \mb \epsilon 
    = \df 1 {\mu k} \mbf p \times \mbf L - \mbf n 
    = \df 1 {\mu k} [\mbf p \times (\mbf r\times \mbf p)] - \mbf n 
    = \df 1 {\mu k} [\mbf p \times (\mbf r\times \mbf p)] - \mbf n 
    = \df {pL} {\mu k} \mbf n - \mbf n 
\] 
The vector is conserved. 

_Proof:_ Direct computation. 
\begin{align}
    \dot {\mb \epsilon} 
    &= \df 1 {\mu k} \mbf F \times \mbf L - \dot {\mbf n} 
    = \df 1 {\mu k} \left(-\df{k}{r^2} \mbf n\right) \times 
    [\mu r^2 \dot \theta (\mbf n \times \mbf l)] - \dot {\mbf n} \\ 
    &= -\dot \theta [\mbf n\times (\mbf n \times \mbf l)] - \dot {\mbf n}
    = \dot \theta \mbf l - \dot {\mbf n} = 0 
\end{align}
:::

::: {.proposition #rungeLenzMagnitude name="magnitude of the Runge-Lenz vector"}
The magnitude $\epsilon = |\mb \epsilon|$ is 
\[ 
    \epsilon^2 = 1 + \df{2EL^2}{\mu k^2}
\] 
_Proof:_ First compute 
$\mbf p\times \mbf L = \mbf p \times (\mbf r \times \mbf p) = Lp\mbf n$. 
Then $\mbf n \cdot (\mbf p\times \mbf L) = Lp$ and 
$|\mbf p\times \mbf L|^2 = p^2L^2$ since $\mbf p \perp \mbf L$. 
Also note that $p/L = 1/r$, then 
then 
\begin{align}
    \epsilon^2 
    &= \mbf n\cdot \mbf n  + \df{1}{\mu^2 k^2}
    [(\mbf p\times \mbf L)\cdot (\mbf p\times \mbf L)]
    - \df{2}{\mu k} \mbf n \cdot (\mbf p\times \mbf L) \\ 
    &= 1 + \df{p^2 L^2}{\mu^2k^2} - 2 \df{pL}{\mu k} 
    = 1 + \df{2L^2}{\mu k^2}\left(\df{p^2}{2\mu} - \df{pk}{L}\right)
    = 1 + \df{2EL^2}{\mu k^2}
\end{align}
:::

## Orbits, effective potential {-}
We can obtain an implicit equation of motion using the conservation equations. 
By definition of $\mb \epsilon$ \@ref(prp:rungeLenzDefinition)
\[ 
    \mbf r\cdot \mb \epsilon 
    = \df{rpL}{\mu k} - r = \df{L^2}{\mu k} - r
\] 
Let $\mbf r\cdot \mb \epsilon = r\epsilon \cos\theta$, 
then the orbit equation reads 
\[ 
    r(1+\cos\theta) = \df{L^2}{\mu k}
     (\#eq:orbitEquation)
\] 

::: {.remark}
Here the orientation is such that $\theta=0$ points along $\mb \epsilon$. 
This is also an _implicit_ orbit equation since time is not an explicit 
variable.  
:::
The lecture note appendix works out the conic section 
trajectories corresponding to different ranges of $\epsilon$. 

::: {.definition #effectivePotential name="effective radial potential"}
So far, the kinetic energy is computed according to the vector derivative 
$\dot {\mbf r}$ 
\[ 
    E = T + V = \df 1 2 \mu \dot {\mbf r}^2 - \df{k}{r}
\] 
In our case, we can reduce this to a scalar problem 
by introducing the effective potential. 
Recall $\dot {\mbf r} = \dot (r\mbf n) 
= \dot r\mbf n + r\dot {\mbf n} = \dot r\mbf n + r\dot \theta \mbf l 
\implies \dot {\mbf r}^2 = \dot r^2 + r^2\dot \theta^2 = \dot r^2 + L^2/\mu^2 r^2$ 
\[ 
    E = \df 1 2 \mu \dot{\mbf r}^2 - \df k r 
    = \df 1 2 \mu \dot r^2 + \left(\df {L^2}{2\mu r^2} - \df k r \right)
\] 
The last term in paranthesis is called the "effective potential $V_{\mrm{eff}}$. 
:::

::: {.remark}
Recall that $L$ is conserved when the potential displays spherical symmetry. 
The effective potential conveniently reduces a _vector problem_ 
into a _scalar problem_ at the cost of introducing a "centrifugal" term. 
This is a prime example of symmetry helping simplify analysis. 
The effective potential reduction will show up again in the 
QM treatment of the hydrogen atom (Physics 143a) and spherical gravity 
correction (Physics 210). 
:::
Energy is conserved along orbits, and we can easily identify the 
bound, unbound, and spherical orbits from the effective-potential graph. 

::: {.exercise name="relativistic gravitational effective-potential"}
Identify the effective potential for Newtonian gravity, where $k=GM$. 
What is the radius of the circular orbit? 

The effective radial potential from a spherical mass according to 
general relativity is 
\[ 
    V_{\mrm{eff}} = -\sigma \df{GM}{r} + \df{L^2}{2r^2} - \df{GML^2}{r^3}
\] 
Where $\sigma=0$ if the particle is massless else $1$. 
What are the behaviors for massive and massless particles?

## Scattering {-}
In scattering problems, we assume a spatially and temporally uniform distribution 
of incoming beams of particles along the incident $z$-axis. 
We use cylindrical coordinates $(z, b, \phi)$ denoting 
height, radius, and the azimuthal angle, respectively. The main quantities are: 

1. Impact parameter $b$, scattering angle $\theta$. 
2. Particles are incident within an infinitesimal patch with cross-sectional 
    area $d\sigma(b, \phi) = b\, db\, d\phi$. 
3. Particle emission are considered according to a solid angle 
    $d\Omega(\theta, \phi) = \sin\theta \, d\theta\, d\varphi$. 
4. The differential cross-section $d_\Omega\sigma \equiv \df{b}{\sin\theta}|d_\theta b|$. 
    Usually, the greater $\theta$ (heavier scattering effect), the smaller $b$, since 
    incident particles shoot closer to the scattering source -- thus the absolute sign. 
5. The total cross-section $\sigma = \int (d_\Omega \sigma)\, d\Omega$. This is the total 
    cross-sectional area which encounters scattering. For classical hard-sphere scattering, 
    this is $\pi R^2$. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/scattering.jpeg", 1))
```

::: {.remark}
When the scattering source is spherically symmetric, 
all dependences on $\phi$ can be dropped. 

The differential cross-section $d_\Omega \sigma$ asks: 
at angle $\theta$ from scattering center, what is the 
impact parameter $b$ and how much unit increase in 
output solid angle will be able to account for unit 
area increase in the incident beams? 
:::

To compute the two-body scattering differential cross-section, 
the first step is deriving the relation between the impact 
parameter $b$ and scattering angle $\theta$. 

::: {.proposition #scatteringRelation name="scattering relation"}
$b(\theta) = \df{|k|}{2E} \cot(\theta/2)$

_Proof:_ Recall the orbit equation \@ref(eq:orbitEquation): 
denote the planar angle $\phi$, 
let $D = \df{L^2}{\mu k}$, and expand in terms of $x, y$
\[ 
    r(1 + \epsilon \cos\phi) = r + \epsilon x = D
\] 
Expanding in terms of $x, y$ 
\begin{align}
    r^2 &= x^2 + y^2 = (D - \epsilon x)^2 \\ 
    y^2 &= (\epsilon^2 - 1)x^2 - 2D\epsilon x + D^2
\end{align}
For repulsive orbits, $\epsilon>1$ and the orbits asymptote to 
\[ 
    y \sim \pm \sqrt{\epsilon^2 - 1} x, \quad |x|\to \infty 
\] 
The scattering angle $\theta$ in the scattering diagram thus satisfy 
\begin{align}
    \tan\theta_{\mrm{max}} = \sqrt{\epsilon^2 - 1}, 
    \quad \tan(\theta/2) = \tan(\pi/2 - \theta_{\mrm{max}}) 
    = \cot(\theta_{\mrm{max}})
\end{align}
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/rutherford_scattering.jpeg", 1))
```
The angular momentum $L$ of the incoming particle can be 
computed at the incident limit: 
\begin{align}
    L &= |\mbf r\times \mbf p| = b p = b\sqrt{2\mu E} \\ 
    \cot(\theta/2) &= \tan(\theta_{\mrm{max}}) 
    = \sqrt{\df{2EL^2}{\mu k^2}} = \df{2bE}{|k|}
\end{align}
:::

::: {.theorem name="Rutherford cross-section formula"}
For repulsive two-body scattering, the cross-section is dependent upon $\theta$ as 
\[ 
    (d_\Omega \sigma)(\theta) = \left(\df{k}{4E}\right)^2 \sin^{-4}\df{\theta}{2}
\] 

_Proof:_ The first step is elucidating the dependence 
$d_\Omega \sigma \leftarrow b,\, d_\theta b \leftarrow \theta$. 
From \@ref(prp:scatteringRelation) we have 
\begin{align}
    b(\theta) &= \df{|k|}{2E}\cot(\theta/2)  \\ 
    d_\theta b &= -\df{|k|}{4E} \mrm{csc}^2(\theta/2)
\end{align}
Substituting into the relation $d_\Omega \sigma = b|d_\theta b|/\sin\theta$ yields 
formula as claimed.
